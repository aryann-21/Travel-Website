      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Rajasthan, the land of kings and forts, mesmerizes with its rich royal heritage. Each city, steeped in history and tradition, narrates stories of valor, grandeur, and timeless elegance that have stood the test of time. In Jaipur, the Pink City, the majestic Hawa Mahal with its intricate latticework and the opulent City Palace showcase the architectural brilliance of the Rajput rulers. The Amber Fort, perched on a hilltop, whispers tales of battles won and strategic alliances forged.

        Jodhpur, the Blue City, boasts the imposing Mehrangarh Fort, towering over the cityscape like a sentinel of the past. Its intricately carved palaces and courtyards offer glimpses into the lives of the Rathore rulers. Udaipur, the City of Lakes, enchants with the ethereal Lake Palace floating on Lake Pichola, reflecting the romance and splendor of Rajasthanâ€™s royalty.

        Further west, in the golden sands of Jaisalmer, the imposing Jaisalmer Fort rises like a mirage from the desert. Known as the Golden Fort, its yellow sandstone walls glow in the setting sun, epitomizing the resilience and architectural prowess of the Bhati Rajputs. The intricately carved havelis of Jaisalmer, adorned with delicate filigree work, narrate tales of prosperity and artistic finesse.
